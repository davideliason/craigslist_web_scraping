""We had a great time staying here at Seaview With a View AIRBNB # 30529748. 
The condo feels private and has all the little and big things you need to feel like you are truly on vacation. The views of the beach/ ocean from the picture window in the living room and master bedroom are stunning. The house is immaculately clean, comfortable, cozy furniture throughout. The kitchen is updated and easy to work in. The jetted oversized tub did not disappoint-- you can see the beach from there too. We were treated with perfectly sunny spring weather for the weekend. Great walks on the beach from the very convenient beach access road. We enjoyed beautiful sun sets on the balcony. The host, Linda, was responsive to my questions before the trip and at check in, but even more than that, kind and generous with their vacation home. Long Beach has some great activities, festivals, and places to eat. This rental an equally great fit for a family trip or a romantic getaway. We appreciated her suggestions for places to go and things to do. We will definitely be back. You won't regret this booking!""

Request my list of almost 100 condos already reserved at Seaside, Gleneden Beach, Depoe Bay, and Central Oregon for spring break next year. I am cancelling reservations that have not rented so contact me immediately if interested.

These are the well-known WorldMark by Wyndham timeshare condos which can only be rented through timeshare owners like myself.

I always provide my listing of units available to people on my email list BEFORE I advertise on Craig's List. I usually send you an email about once per month to update you on availability. You do NOT have to listen to a timeshare sales presentation to rent from me, an individual owner.

Seascape Cottage
$145-$351
3 Bedroom, 2 Bath, Sleeps 7
seabrookwa.com/vacation-rentals/seascape

Quiet and private, this spacious three bedroom home with room for seven is located steps away from the new Town Hall.

Walking distance from the indoor pool, shops, restaurant and pub and trails to the beach. Seascape is ideally situated within Seabrook, the Madison Lane neighborhood is adjacent to Seabrook's town center, yet offers some of the most tranquil woodland views that Seabrook has to offer.

Stylish, roomy, and comfortable! After cycling around the town of Seabrook or exploring the nearby beach, park your furnished bikes and unwind in the spacious living area. Have a seat on the plush couch or kick off your shoes and put your feet up on the ottoman. You could catch a cable show on the flat-screen TV, watch a movie on DVD, or bring up the laptop and check on local events and sites... but chances are, the view of the woodlands through the window will distract you. Why resist? Slip out onto the covered deck and sip your drink or take advantage of the hammock as you relax!

There are two bedrooms downstairs; one with a queen bed and one with a twin over full bunk bed including a twin pull out trundle! The third bedroom with a queen bed is on the main floor. Up to seven guests can comfortably share the space. The home also has two full bathrooms and a washer and dryer, so you can pack light!

Though there are some nice places to eat, you may want to prepare some meals yourself. No problem! You'll have everything you'll need to fix a great meal - morning, noon, or night - in this fully equipped kitchen with a big refrigerator, microwave, and plenty of cabinet space to hold the supplies you brought. And remember, you're in seafood country, so how about some surf and turf? Just click on the grill and enjoy a barbecue out in the beautiful outdoors.

Whether you choose to just hang out at this beautiful home or go out and explore the rugged coastal beauty of the pacific coast, you'll come away with lots of memories and, very likely, an urge to return soon!

Please note: The property is located approximately one flight down from street level on one side. It is located in Madison Lane's incredible sloped wooded lots with a front porch overlooking the woods.    "

Pickleball
What is Pickleball?
Pickleball originated on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The first Pickleball game was played on a summer afternoon in 1965, at the home of Joel Pritchard, a famous Washington State Politician and US Congressman. While attempting to play a game of badminton, Congressman Pritchard and his friends couldn’t find a shuttlecock. So instead, they lowered the net, built paddles out of plywood, and played with a Wiffle ball. Pickleball was born.

By combining elements of badminton, tennis, and paddle tennis, Pickleball creates an exciting game in a small space. It’s great forIt’s great for spectators and tournaments. It doesn’t require lots of running and the ball is served underhand so it’s great for active seniors who enjoy competition and want to continue to stay healthy.
